# Modeling and Forecasting Total Gross Gas Consumption in France - Time Series Forecasting

## Dataset ðŸ“Š

Our study is based on the dataset provided by **ODRE: Open Data RÃ©seaux Ã‰nergie**, a consortium that includes, among others, GRTgaz and TerÃ©ga. These groups operate within the natural gas supply chain, with GRTgaz handling transportation and TerÃ©ga managing gas storage. Their clients are players in the gas market who intervene at various stages of the production, distribution, and commercialization of natural gas, as well as industrial consumers.

## Overview ðŸŒŸ

We study the total gross gas consumption in France. It is measured in Megawatts (MW), using the convention of a Higher Heating Value (HHV) at 0 degrees Celsius. This corresponds to the total amount of heat released at constant volume by the combustion of one kilogram of fuel. The measurements cover the period 2012â€“2023.

We chose to train our model on 80% of the available data, which corresponds to the period from 2012 to mid-2020. We then attempt to predict the daily total gross gas consumption in France from October 2021 to December 2022.

Key steps of the project include:
- Decomposition of the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals
- Implementation and benchmarking of several models: AR, MA, ARMA
- Residual analysis to assess model adequacy
- Forecasting daily gas consumption in France from October 2021 to December 2022

## Models Implemented ðŸ§®

- **Moving Average** (MA)
- **Autoregressive** (AR)
- **Autoregressive Moving Average** (ARMA)

## Benchmarking Metrics ðŸ“ˆ

The benchmarking of the time series models (MA, AR, ARMA) relied on several evaluation tools:

- **Akaike Information Criterion** (AIC): Used to compare model fit while penalizing complexity, with the best model selected based on the lowest AIC value.
- **Durbin-Watson Test**: Applied to residuals to detect the presence of autocorrelation, ensuring they behaved like white noise.
- **Q-Q Plot** & **Residual Histogram**: Used to assess the normality of residuals and verify whether they followed a Gaussian distribution centered around zero.
- **Autocorrelation Function** (ACF) of Residuals: Checked for the absence of correlation between residuals, validating the white noise assumption.
- **Root Mean Square Error** (RMSE): Quantified the prediction accuracy, with lower values indicating better performance.

ðŸ”Ž These combined metrics allowed the selection of the ARMA(11,3) model as the best-performing one for forecasting total gas consumption in France:
- RMSE â‰ˆ 0.53, consistent with the scale of observed data.
- The ARMA(11,3) model provided the most reliable forecasts.
- Adding external variables (e.g., temperature, energy crisis data) could further improve accuracy.
